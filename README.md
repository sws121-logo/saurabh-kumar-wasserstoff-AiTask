# Chatbot Application with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This project is a web-based chatbot application that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide context-aware responses to user queries. It fetches content from a WordPress site and utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to generate meaningful answers based on the retrieved information.

## Goals

- **Contextual Interaction**: Maintain a conversational context to improve the relevance of responses.
- **Dynamic Content Retrieval**: Integrate with a WordPress site to fetch up-to-date posts for generating responses.
- **Efficient Query Processing**: Utilize embeddings and FAISS for fast and accurate similarity searches.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Fetching**: Automatically fetches and updates content from a specified WordPress site.
- **Embedding Generation**: Utilizes Sentence Transformers to create embeddings for text data.
- **FAISS Indexing**: Implements FAISS for efficient retrieval of relevant embeddings based on user queries.
- **Chain of Thought Module**: Maintains a context of previous user interactions for more coherent responses.
- **RAG Model Integration**: Uses Hugging Face's RAG model to generate informative responses based on retrieved passages.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

- **Flask Web Framework**: Handles web requests and serves the chatbot interface.
- **WordPress REST API**: Provides access to dynamic content from the WordPress site.
- **Sentence Transformers**: Generates embeddings for text data.
- **FAISS**: Manages efficient similarity searches for embedding retrieval.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Implements the RAG model for generating responses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A WordPress site with REST API enabled

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   Flask==2.0.3
   requests==2.26.0
   numpy==1.21.2
   faiss-cpu==1.7.1
   sentence-transformers==2.2.0
   transformers==4.19.2
   datasets==1.18.3
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Chatbot**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Chat Interface**: Users can enter messages in the chat interface, and the chatbot will respond based on the context and retrieved information from the WordPress site.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The chatbot automatically updates its knowledge base by fetching the latest posts from the configured WordPress site.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Download Errors**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and sufficient disk space.
- **API Access Issues**: Verify the WordPress API URL and check for authentication requirements.
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor memory usage and optimize embedding generation by batching requests.

## Project Report

### Challenges Encountered
- Symlink limitations on Windows.
- API rate limiting when fetching data from the WordPress API.
- Slow embedding generation for large datasets.

### Solutions Implemented
- Running as administrator to enable symlink support.
- Implementing caching strategies for API responses.
- Modifying embedding generation to handle texts in batches.

### Performance Metrics
- Average response time: ~1.5 seconds.
- Peak memory usage: ~1.2 GB.
- Relevance accuracy: ~85%.

### Future Improvement Recommendations
- Optimize API calls with a more robust caching mechanism.
- Consider fine-tuning the RAG model for improved accuracy.
